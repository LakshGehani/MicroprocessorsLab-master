# üïπÔ∏è Space Invaders on a PIC18 Microprocessor

This project implements the classic arcade game **Space Invaders** on a **PIC18F87K22 microcontroller**, programmed entirely in **assembly (MPASM)** and run on the **EasyPIC Pro V7** board. It demonstrates how interactive embedded systems can be designed under strict hardware constraints using low-level programming.

## üíª Software Design

- **Language:** Assembly (MPASM)
- **IDE:** MPLAB X IDE
- **Design:** Modular ‚Äî separate files and routines for input handling, game logic, movement, rendering, and sound
- **Input:** Handled via interrupt-driven keypad scanning on PORT E
- **Output:** 128x64 GLCD connected via PORT B & D, buzzer controlled via PORT B pin 6

## üîÅ Main Game Loop

![Game Loop Flowchart](Reports/space_flow.drawio.png)

The game loop handles:
- Scanning keypad input (left, right, shoot, start/reset)
- Updating player/enemy/bullet positions
- Detecting collisions
- Managing game state and score
- Drawing to GLCD and triggering sound
- Introducing a 90ms delay to stabilize framerate (‚âà 9.5 FPS)

## üß± Software Architecture

![Top-down Modular Diagram](Reports/top-down.png)

The software is organized into clear layers:
- **Initialization** of hardware components
- **User Input Module** with interrupt polling
- **Game Engine** for logic control and physics
- **Graphics Engine** for LCD pixel rendering
- **Audio Module** for PWM-based sound effects

## üìä Performance & Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frame Rate | 9.5 ¬± 0.04 FPS |
| Program Memory Used | 2.5% |
| Data Memory Used | 2.3% |
| Collision Detection | 100% Accuracy |
| Frame Duration Deviation | ¬± 0.48 ms |

Key takeaways:
- Smooth visual performance with minimal GLCD flickering
- Consistent frame updates with 90ms delays
- Interrupt-based keypad ensures fast and accurate user input
- Bullet‚Äìenemy and enemy‚Äìplayer collisions handled with edge-case detection

## üß© Features

- Real-time gameplay on 128x64 LCD
- Bullet cooldown and shooting logic
- Score tracking and bitmap display
- Game-over and title screen bitmaps
- Randomized enemy spawning using Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
- Audio tones generated via toggling signal on buzzer pin

## üöß Limitations & Improvements

**Current limitations:**
- No persistent high score memory (lost on power cycle)
- No life system ‚Äì game ends on first hit
- No level progression or difficulty scaling
- GLCD updates can bottleneck when multiple objects move

**Suggested enhancements:**
- Store high score in EEPROM (1kB available)
- Add lives system using bitmap icons
- Introduce level system with enemy patterns/speeds
- Optimise GLCD writes to only redraw changed pixels

**Key takeaways from the project**
- Understanding how to use PIC18 Microprocessor and other electrical components
- Writing assembly instructions to the processor to update I/O peripherals
- Structuring modular code for further additons and debugging.
